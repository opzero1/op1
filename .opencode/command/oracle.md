Consult the Oracle for strategic guidance on a complex decision or debugging challenge.

**Consultation:** $ARGUMENTS

The Oracle will:
1. Analyze the problem and constraints
2. List all viable approaches with trade-offs
3. Provide a clear recommendation with reasoning
4. Outline implementation steps
5. Identify potential pitfalls

Use Oracle when:
- Architecture decisions have significant trade-offs
- Debugging has failed 2+ times
- Design pattern selection is unclear
- Performance optimization strategy needed
- Security-sensitive design required
